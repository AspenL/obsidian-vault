## Description 

#### Awakening
Her first words are "I can't give up now..." before the tether is completed anchoring her Ba and Ib to her new body
Velriana is going to come back from the dead, in a new body as a ????

At first she awakens as if from a dream, pawing around for a wand that isn't there.
Then she is furious once she realizes she is no longer human nor looks anything like herself.

She has effectively lost her nobility and needs to at least true polymorph herself back into what she used to look like.
She will demand her effects and possessions back, settling for the wand of scorching ray back at the barest minimum.

She doesn't give a fuck about threats, what will they do? Kill her again??
Great, she'll just keep on going about her afterlife
#### Actual info

She is native to Grigongia and very proud of her station, both as a noble and a giant-blooded aristocrat
As far as Milo is concerned they aren't blood related. His family lived in her property and they were raised together. Velriana's late father was less vain and acted as an 'uncle' of sorts (he also had had a fling with Milo's mom and never quite moved on).
Her mom encouraged him to go on a hunting trip in which he tragically passed, then she kicked Milo's family out and married a richer noble eventually.

She doesn't know jack about the Forgotten Pharaoh
She hired the thugs by bribing her way to dockmaster Ahmeb Tekhra who put her in contact with the [[Silver Chain]].
She thought it strange that the envoy wore a golden mask, but assumed it was to keep their anonymity.
They met on a small rowboat in the Veins at night, and identified themselves as [[Nafi]], then arranged for her to meet with a group on "adventurers" the following morning.
She could lead them to where they met, but it is just a rooftop on a warehouse
It'd be more profitable to have the dockmaster arrange another meeting, or simply ask around in the Veins
