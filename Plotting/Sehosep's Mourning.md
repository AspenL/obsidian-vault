## Description 

The bramble sorceress Sehesep Nahn was in the middle of the rites of embalming her husband when the Ka pulse hit, reanimating him as a zombie
This completely broke her already fragile emotional state.
She wants to fully bring him back.

She has little formal training in magic, believing that her earnestness and sorcerous connection to the fey was what restored a semblance of life to her husband's corpse.
She needs to believe this, for her sanity. The truth is too horrible to bear, if she acknowledges that Bentu's corpse was desecrated by foul magic while she tended to his burial rites she will collapse entirely.

And if her magic was enough to bring him back through some unknown means then she'll do whatever needs doing to restore his Ba to her love.


The party caught a mob trying to lynch her husband and intervened.
