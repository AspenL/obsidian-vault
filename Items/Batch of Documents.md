#### Origin

[[Wati]], the tomb of a priest of [[Thoth]] in the [[Archives of the Ibis]]
#### Plans & Plot Relevance

This should allow [[The Dragon]] to learn more about their familial history and the role Dragons played in ancient times.



##### What is learnable within

The ancient dragons were revered akin to gods, or seen as favored servants of the gods.

The most complete libraries besides the Archives of the Ibis at the time were likely those in [[Tephu]], the [[Thanagolth|Golthian]]s tend to be quite secretive and protective of their knowledge so their records are not only expansive but built to last and endure with little maintenance.
Given that [[Thanagolth]] is the god of Blood, it is likely there are quite a few genealogical records in their vaults. 

The Pharaonic line has always been somewhat convoluted and often the new Pharaoh had a grievance of some sort with their predecessor and erased or stole credit for their accomplishments.
That is only compounded by the great cultural losses caused by the [[Nishil Interregnum]]
In fact many noble lines were lost to time and many who live today may have had a claim that was forgotten in-between.


There are dragons who are notorious for taking humanoid shapes to mingle and interact with the mortal societies, so it is not entirely out of the question that one such shapeshifting emperor might have existed.

There were a few Pharaohs who claimed the title of "Dragon Pharaoh" or similar but none specifically who were explicitly non-humanoids


Sidestep
> Besides the usual and commonly known metallic and chromatic dragons there are the rarer gemstone dragons.
> But in ancient times there used to be a grander type of dragon, [[Primordial Dragons]] of which there were only a few.
> Those Elemental Dragons if the sparse legends are to be believed were powerful enough to rival a god and controlled each one fundamental aspect of reality, one of the elements.
>
>  Those who believe in the might of these grand elementals espouse that the gods were granted their divinity by a council of Primordials. That Suthelia was not founded by Ra in the desert, but lifted up from the seas by either the Earth or Water Dragon.
> It would explain why dragonborn are so common in the surrounding lands from a creationist point of view.
